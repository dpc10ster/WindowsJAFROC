# WindowsJAFROC

This repository contains a file `SetupV4.2.1.zip` which, when unzipped, contains the installation files for Windows JAFROC software version 4.2.1. This is the latest software that used to be downloadable from my now defunct `website www.devchakraborty.com`. This software is now replaced (and extended) by the `RJafroc` package. It is made available here as many have found it to be particularly easy to use. It was last tested on Windows 8 but I am no longer maintaining it. Click on the file to download it.
